Test Driven Development Notes


Describe: PizzaPie()

Test 1: "Constructor function should return an instance of 'PizzaPie' with two properties, one for size, and one for toppings (an array)."
Code: const firstPie = new PizzaPie("small", ["cheese", "pepperoni"]);
Expected Output: 
firstPie;
PizzaPie {
  size: "small",
  toppings: ["cheese", "pepperoni"]
}
